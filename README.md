<h1 align="center">âš“ Battleship âš“</h1>

This project serves as the final project for the JavaScript module in The Odin Project curriculum. It's a web-based implementation of the classic Battleship game, allowing local matches between two players or against a CPU~(soon)~.


**Technologies Used:**

-   **Frontend:**
    -   HTML
    -   CSS
    -   JavaScript (ES6)
-   **Build Tools:**
    -   Webpack (for bundling modules)
-   **Testing:**
    -   Jest (unit testing framework)
<br>

**Learning Objectives:**

-   **Solidify JavaScript (ES6) fundamentals** by applying concepts like classes, modularization and DOM manipulation to build a dynamic web application
-   **Implement game logic** by developing mechanics like ship placement, attack resolution, win/lose conditions, and AI decision-making algorithms ~(soon)~
-   **Gain experience with Webpack**  for efficient code bundling and project management.
-   **Get familiar with unit teststing** by employing Jest to write a test suite to improve code quality, functionality and maintainability
